# VOICE-RECOGNITION
The Voice Recognition System is designed to capture, process, and interpret human speech, enabling seamless interaction between users and digital devices. The project leverages speech-to-text (STT) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to convert spoken words into actionable commands or textual data.
